# Advent of Code

Some poorly written Haskell!

## Purpose

I mainly wanted to do the Advent of Code this year (2022) because I've come to
enjoy Haskell a lot but when it comes to algorithms I don't have to deal with
the same sort of issues that arise in these competitive programming questions.
String manipulation specifically is something that comes very easily in the
language I usually use for these problems (Python, can't beat `split`, `join`,
`strip`, etc). So, you'll probably see some ugly uses of `Data.Text` until I
figure out a better way or am told this is the best.

I prioritize speed over elegance throughout these problems, it's just second
nature for these sorts of problems.
